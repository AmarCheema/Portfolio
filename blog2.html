      <p>There’s been a lot of noise lately about AI taking over everything—including our jobs as developers. And yeah, I get it. Tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and all these fancy “no-code” platforms are evolving fast. They can write decent code, help you debug, even generate whole components in a few seconds. But here’s the thing—AI might be fast, but it still doesn’t think like a real developer.</p>

      <p>When I’m working on a project, it's not just about getting code to run. There’s a ton of decisions that go into every component—how users will interact with it, how it fits into the bigger picture, how it feels on mobile, whether it even makes sense for the problem we're trying to solve. That kind of decision-making comes from experience, instinct, and honestly, a lot of trial and error. AI doesn’t have that gut feeling.</p>

      <p>Another big thing: people. When I’m coding, I’m thinking about how someone will actually use what I’m building. Will they get confused? Will it feel smooth? Is it accessible? These aren’t just technical questions—they’re human ones. AI can suggest a layout, sure, but it doesn’t know what frustrates users or what makes them smile. It doesn’t care if a button’s too small on a phone or if the contrast is off for someone with vision issues. We do.</p>

      <p>And let’s not forget how messy real-world code can be. Projects have weird legacy stuff, rushed fixes, plugins from five years ago, and business rules that barely make sense anymore. AI might help with clean, isolated problems, but it doesn’t always get the weird edge cases or the random hack you had to write at 2 AM to make something work. Navigating that kind of chaos is part of the job, and it’s where human brains shine.</p>

      <p>Also, building stuff is rarely a solo mission. We work with designers, PMs, clients, and other devs. We explain ideas, give feedback, change plans halfway through a sprint, and sometimes just sit together and figure stuff out. AI’s not hopping in a Zoom call to help you brainstorm or explain to a client why their feature request breaks everything.</p>

      <p>That said, I’m not anti-AI. I actually use it a lot—sometimes it helps me move faster or gives me a fresh idea when I’m stuck. It’s a great tool. But that’s the key word: <strong>tool</strong>. It’s not the builder. That’s still us.</p>

      <p>So no, I don’t think AI is coming for our jobs. Not the good ones, anyway. The way I see it, it’s just changing how we work—not replacing who we are. And honestly? I’m cool with that.</p>
